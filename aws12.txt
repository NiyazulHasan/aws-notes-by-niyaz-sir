Assume you belongs to a team which develops Payment application
===============================================================
Whenever you want to test or install payment application we need to do following things.

1) Create a server. 

2) Install a package (In cloud environment package means software).

3) Create a configuration file. 

4) Update the value from YAHOO to FACEBOOK.

5) Copy the file and paste in "/home/centos/payment/secret.conf".

Do you know what payment team does ?

1) They will create a server and do all the steps from 2 to 5.

2) Make an AMI(Amazon Machine Image) out of it and inform your team to use this 
   image when they want to test the payment application.


Steps to create AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
============================================
step1:
-----
	Goto existing launch template i.e cart-app-dev or payment-app-dev.

step2:
------
	Launch EC2 instance from template.

step3:
-----
	Now create AMI.

	Note:
	------
	If we enable Reboot then we will get 100% best copy/AMI.
		 

	
	Remember : Time taken to AMI is highly dependent on 

	1) Size of the disk
	2) How big the server is 
	3) How buzy the system is 

step4:
-----
	Now launch the template from AMI.
	


uptime
-------
A uptime command is used to show you since when machine is up.

ex:
	$ uptime 

	Check wheather all the things which we created on payment application
	is there or not.
	ex:
		$ ls -ltr 



Q) If you server is not coming on AWS , What will you do?

Many people say they will do 

1) Try to check the console logs.

2) I will raise a support call with AWS.

These are under rated options.

We have options for instance screenshot and system logs.




Q) Will AMI creating falls in billing?

Yes, AMI creating falls in billing because it contains disk.
As we know only 35gb Disk as a free tier.

	
Q)Is is possible to run multiple servers at a time?

Yes , it is possible to run multiple servers in xshell.

We need to copy public IP address of each server and use in xshell.



Project Description
==================
In our training we will do two projects.

1) Monolithic project (3 servers)

2) Micro-Service project (13 servers)


Instana is a company acquired by IBM.

Instana is a company which offers Observability and Monitoring platform.

They have open source project , we are going to do that.
