A /boot/ directory contains all the operating system related entries and packages.

A /dev/ directory contains all the devices that are connected to the system.

A /etc/ directory contains all the system configuration related entities.

A /home/ directory contains all the users which are existing in a system.

	/home/centos
	/home/niyazsir

A /lib/ directory contains the packages which are required for addition softwares.

In windows, if we want to install any software.

In linux, If we want to install any package.

1) We need to use package manager in linux.

package manager helps you in downloading the packages from the internet and install.

ex:
	yum (Redhat Based Machines)
	apt (Debian Based Machines)

syntax:
	# yum install packageName

> lets install some packages.
ex:
	$ yum install nginx
	  (You Need to be root to perform this command).

	$ sudo yum install nginx

	  sudo is a tool/command to access root privileges temperory.

	$ sudo yum install nginx -y

	  -y means auto approve.

1) yum (Preferred:YUM has the advantage of handling all the needed pre-req softwares)

2) rpm(Red-hat Package Manager) : is an open source program for installing,     uninstalling, and managing software packages in Linux. 

3) Source Code Based Installation (Download the code , compile and use it).
