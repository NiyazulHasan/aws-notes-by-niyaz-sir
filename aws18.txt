Need of Elastic IP Address
==========================
Whenever we create a server we will get a public IP address.

Using that public IP , we will connect to the server.

Public IP's are costly.

So we need to pay for it , when you don't use.

Whenever we shutdown the server and start it ,your public IP will change but not private IP.

We efficiently uses IP Address.

You know Amazon is given the IP addresses by paying .In order to use it efficiently Amazon is taking it back.

In companies things will not work in that way.
ex:
	For example , you have a server and you published the IP address to everyone.
	It should not be the case every time you shutdown the server .You get 
	new IP address and you update the team by saying hey this is new IP Address.
	You don't do that right?

	In order to address this , we have a concept called Elastic IP Address
	in AWS.


Elastic IP Address
==================
An Elastic IP address is a reserved public IP address that you can assign to any EC2 instance in a particular region, until you choose to release it.

> We will check-in(buy) the elastic IP.

> We will assign this eip to EC2.

> Lets stop and start EC2

> The Elastic IP remains same.

Note:
------
1) Elastic IP's are costly.

2) How billing works for elastic ip's?

> you have taken elastic IP,you have allocated to your server and server is up 
  then No Billing.

> you have taken elastic IP, you have not allocated to any server then Billing.

> you have taken elastic IP, you have allocated to server and server is not up then
  Billing.
