First Project Development in AWS
==================================
To develop this project we required following servers.

1)FrontEnd Server/Web Server (It is a public server)

2)Application Server /BackEnd Server

3)Database Server

Diagram: aws20.1

step1:
-----
	create a security group by using below name.
	ex:
		b54-allow-all

	Diagrams: 

step2:
------
	Create a launch template by using below name.
	ex:
		b54-LabImage-Spot

	Diagrams: 


	Note:
	----
	FrontEnd Server : 

	It is also known as web server.
	It is developed by frontend team.
	We use following technologies.
	ex:
		Angular, React , Vue , Ember & etc - for web development.
		Flutter, React Native, Andriod , Swift & etc- for mobile development.

	Backend Server :
	
	It is also known as application server.
	It is developed by backend team.
	We use following technologies.
	ex:
		Java, Python, Golang, NodeJS, ExpressJS and etc. 
	
	Database Server : 

	It is developed by DB team.
	We use following technologies.
	ex:
		MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB , NoSQL, MariaDB and etc.
		    	
step3:
-----
	Launch three Instances/Servers from launch template.
	
	Diagrams:

step4:
-----
	Connect to the FrontEnd server.
	ex:
		centos/DevOps321 
					
step5:
-----
	Set the hostname to the server to identify.
	ex:
		$ sudo set-hostname frontend (It is customized command)


step6:
-----

	If you have any issue during the practice ,kindly share me photos like below 		format because it includes metadata.
	
	Diagram:

step7:
------
	Install apache Web server.
	ex:
		$ sudo yum install httpd -y 
		
step8:
-----
	Enable the service.
	ex:
		$ sudo systemctl enable httpd 

step9:
------	
	Start the service.
	ex:
		$ sudo systemctl start httpd 

step10:
------
	Check the service running or not.
	ex:
		$ sudo systemctl status httpd

step11:
-------
	Check list of port numbers are available on the system.
	In which port number that service is running.
	ex:
		$ sudo netstat -tulpn 

	Diagram: 

step12:
-------
	Lets check our connection giving me response or not.
	First copy and public IP address and paste it on the browser address bar.
	ex:
		44.201.209.155:80
		or
		44.201.209.155

	Diagram: 	

	Note: I don't need default response. I need nice the good response which is
	designed by a frontend developer team.

step13:
------
	We will keep the website content in below directory.
	ex:
		$ cd /var/www/html/
		$ ls -ltr 

		total 0 - (output)

	Diagram: 

step14:
------
	Now download the file which is given by frontend developer.	
	ex:

	$ wget https://learndevopswithaws.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

	or

	$ sudo wget https://learndevopswithaws.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

	$ ls -ltr 

step15:
-------
	Whenever you download anything inside the html directory or 
	whenever you do any changes inside system files , 
	we need to restart the service.
	ex:
		$ sudo systemctl restart httpd
 
		$ sudo systemctl status httpd 		

step16:
-----
	Refresh the browser address bar to see new output.
	
	Diagram: 

step17:
-------
	Now click to hyperlink i.e "Enter to Register".

	Note: Page Not Found.

	If someone given the request to application it goes to frontend and 
	once the user click for register , request will forward to backend server.
	For safety concern we need to do this.
