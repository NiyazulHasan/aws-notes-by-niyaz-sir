EBS : Elastic Block Storage or EBS volumes 
=============================================
EBS stands for Elastic Block Store.

EC2 is a virtual server in a cloud while EBS is a virtual disk in a cloud.

Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to the EC2 instances.

Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific availability zone.

Once the storage volume is created, you can create a file system on the top of these volumes, and then you can run a database, store the files, applications and etc.

As a part of free-tier we can use upto 30gb disk is free.
ex:
	https://aws.amazon.com/free/

Whenever we create a EC2 Instance , by default 5gb of EBS volumes will be allocated.
