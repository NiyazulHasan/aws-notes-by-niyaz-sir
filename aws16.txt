Q)What is the difference between curl and wget ?

curl						wget
-------						--------
Curl has the capability to download the 	wget has the capability only 
content/file and browse the content/file.       to download the file/content.


To browse something from the internet we will use curl.

ex:
	$ curl https://github.com/NiyazulHasan/aws-notes-by-niyaz-sir/README.md

          (It will browse the file)		 

	$ curl -o  https://github.com/NiyazulHasan/aws-notes-by-niyaz-sir/README.md

	  (It will download the file)


To download something from the internet we will use wget.
ex:
	$ wget https://github.com/NiyazulHasan/aws-notes-by-niyaz-sir/README.md

	$ ls -ltr 


Note:
-------
In windows we will use zip file to compress multiple files into single file and later we can unzip.

Similarly , In linux we will use tar to packing multiple files into single file and later we can untar.

In linux , in order to prevent intigrity of the files.

ex:

	Assume I create multiple files and will package then into a single file.

	Diagram: aws16.1

	What if i am given a software by tampering file some files.
	Here tampering means i updated some files and i gave it to you.
	In order to prevent tampering of the published software , it is always 
	recommanded to published the software in compression format or tar format.
			
Let see how to download the software in linux
------------------------------------------------
step1:
------
	Goto apache tomcat server page to download.
	ex:
		https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi

step2:
-----
	Copy the link address of a software file.
	ex:
		Right click to "tar.gz" file --> copy link address.

step3:
----
	Now use wget to download a file.
	ex:
	$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.91/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.91.tar.gz

	Note:
	------
	Here we will get error/blocker.
	To overcome this limitation we will use below flag as mention in error.

	$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.91/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.91.tar.gz --no-check-certificate

	$ ls -ltr  (file will be downloaded)

How to extract/unpacking the file
-----------------------------------
ex:
	$ man tar
	$ tar -xf apache-tomcat-8.5.91.tar.gz
	$ ls -ltr 
	$ cd apache-tomcat-8.5.91 (move to directory)
	$ ls -ltr 



Linux Pipes (|)
==============
Pipe in linux helps to send the output of first command as a input to the second command.

ex:
	$ cat /etc/passwd | head -n 5 (Reading first five lines from the file)

	$ cat /etc/passwd | tail -n 8 (Reading last 8 lines from the file)

	$ cat /etc/passwd | tail -n 8 | head -n 3 
	  (Reading last 8 lines from the file then top 3 lines from the file)

	
Linux grep
=============
This is a basic filter in linux.
ex:
	$ cat /etc/passwd | grep mail (It display lines having mail word)

	$ cat /etc/passwd | grep centos (It display lines having mail centos)
	
	$ cat /etc/passwd | grep root (It display lines having mail root)

		
Linux Run Levels
================

Runlevel	Description
---------	-------------
0		System halt i.e., the system can be safely powered off 
		with no activity.

1		Single user mode.

2		Multiple user mode with no NFS (network file system).

3		Multiple user modes under the command line interface and 
		not under the graphical user interface.

4		User-definable.

5		Multiple user mode under GUI (graphical user interface) and this 
		is the standard runlevel for most of the LINUX-based systems.

6		Reboot which is used to restart the system.


ex:
	To check the run level we will use below command.

		$ runlevel   (3)

ex:
	To shutdown the machine we will use below commands.
	
		$ sudo shutdown -h now 
			or
		$ sudo halt 		
			or
		$ sudo init 0
	       
ex:
	To restart the machine we will use below commands.

		$ sudo init 6 	       	
			or
		$ sudo reboot 
			or
		$ sudo shutdown -r now 	

ex:
	To verify whether the system is rebooted or not.
	
		$ uptime 	


Linux process Management 
=========================
In windows to see all the processes we will goto task manager.

In linux to see all the processes we will use top.

A "top" is a task manager in linux.

ex:
	$ top 

	If our server not executing the jobs on time then we will read 
	top command details like load average , number of zombie and what 
	is cpu and memeory utilization.	

	or


	$ ps 
	$ man ps 
	$ ps -ef (It shows all the processes)
	$ ps -U centos (It shows all the process only for centos user)


Note:
----
	Each and every process running in a machine in your linux server will 
	have process id.

	Each every process that has been developed by a process is called parent 
	process.It means every process id is called parent process id.

How to kill the process in linux
---------------------------------
syntax:

	$ kill processID
	$ kill -9 processID (forcefully killed it)

	$ top (It shows the process id)
	$ kill 991
	$ kill -9 991


Linux User Management 
=====================
syntax:
	$ useradd username

ex:
	$ useradd mike (it shows permission denied)

	$ sudo useradd mike (It creates the user)
	$ sudo useradd steve
	$ sudo useradd peter

	$ id (It shows the details of properties of specific user i.e our details)

	$ id mike (It shows user account exists or not)
	$ id steve
	$ id peter

	$ id jose (it shows no such user)

	$ sudo useradd sangeeta
	$ sudo useradd siri
	$ sudo useradd swapna 
	$ id sangeeta 
	$ id siri
	$ id swapna 
	
	$ cat /etc/passwd (It contains all user account details)
